# Prototype Storage Management App

## What this project is for

The point of this project is for me to learn the basics of React Native.

Since I'm happy with React and I've written a PWA using it, it makes sense to try this and see what kind of experience PWA users are missing.

A subgoal was to get better at Figma so I've been using that to design the app.
